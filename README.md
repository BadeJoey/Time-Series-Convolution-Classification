# Time-Series-Convolution-Classification
This is a Convolution Classification Model for a Time Series. It includes a logger and saves the best parameter over multiple runs. It has a Normal, GridSearch and RandomSearch implementation. It also saves a visual representation of the best model so that you don't only have the best Hyperparameter but also the model structure.
